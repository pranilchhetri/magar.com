				Makar Sankranti 2018
			</h2>
			<p>
				Jan 16, 2018-Maghi or Makar Sankranti, one of the most popular Nepali festivals, was observed throughout the country on Monday, by taking holy dips in rivers and ponds, worshipping at various temples and savouring various delicacies like ghee, yam, khichadi and sweets.

The festival marks the sunâ€™s transit into Makara (Capricorn) which means the end of the winter solstice and the start of longer days.

Celebrations were held across the country.

A large number of devotees thronged Hindu shrines, especially at confluence of major rivers, to mark the festival.

The festival is also considered a good day to bathe in sacred rivers and lakes to offer thanks to the sun and wash away sins.

Devotees took holy dips at Devghat, Dolalghat, Baraha Kshetra, Ridi and Triveni among other rivers, across the country. Big religious fairs were held on the day, especially at the confluence of the Kali Gandaki and Trishuli rivers in Devghat.
